TODO: check and refactor the code-duplications in _Data if needed
TODO: work more on MassiveSequence, the generator-based approach
TODO: follow the same idea with every _Data or at least have an option for this
TODO: further improve the generator-based approach! Raw data is still held in RAM
TODO: write tests to parsers! Create more etalon data!
TODO: Feature: embedding is not working, check it!
TODO: reimplement the autoencode transformation with CsxNet!

General idea would be to read the data as batches from the disc
- How do I shuffle this massive data if it doesn't fit in RAM?
- Wouldn't I/O slow down learning?
- Check out asyncIO and the new native coroutines
